In the history of physics, Faraday proposed the use of electric field lines to describe electric fields by drawing an analogy with the flow velocity lines of an incompressible fluid. The distribution of an electrostatic field can be visually described using electric field lines, with the electrostatic force constant known as $k$. In a vacuum, there is a positive point charge with charge $Q$, and the distribution of electric field lines around it is shown in Figure 1. At a distance $r$ from the point charge, there is a point $P$. Additionally, consider a sufficiently large, stationary body of water with a negligible-sized spherical nozzle placed deep enough below the surface, which uniformly sprays water in all directions. Once steady state is achieved, the magnitude and direction of the water's flow velocity vary at different points in space. To visually describe the distribution of water velocity in space, one can introduce \"flow velocity lines\" for the water. Since water is incompressible, the shape of these \"flow velocity lines\" in this scenario is similar to the electric field lines in Figure 2, with the direction of the arrows indicating the direction of velocity, and the density of the \"flow velocity lines\" reflecting the magnitude of the water flow velocity.\n\n1.

By slowly tuning the pin valve, air is gradually injected into the F-P etalon and finally the air pressure reaches the standard atmospheric pressure.

Based on this phenomenon, calculate the refractive index of air $n_{\\text{air}}$ at the standard atmospheric pressure.\n4. Energy levels splitting of Sodium atoms occurs when they are placed in a magnetic field. This is called as the Zeeman effect.

When a current is passed through the system, a quantized Hall resistance is observed, indicating the presence of fractionally charged quasiparticles. We consider a classical model of electrons with effective mass $m$, moving in perpendicular electric and magnetic fields and relate it to the quantum model of vortices and quasiholes. The system's properties are analyzed at a Hall plateau of $R_H = \\frac{3h}{e^2}$.\n\n1. Determine the magnitude of the velocity $v_s$ of the electrons in the stationary case.\n2. The Hall resistance is defined as $R_H = \\frac{V_H}{I}$. In the classical model, find $R_H$ as a function of the number of the electrons $N$ and the magnetic flux $\\phi = BA = BWL$, where $A$ is the area of the sample, and $W$ and $L$ the effective width and length of the sample, respectively.\n3. We know that electrons move in circular orbits in the magnetic field. In the quantum mechanical picture, the impinging magnetic field $B$ could be viewed as creating tiny whirlpools, so-called vortices, in the sea of electrons\u2014one whirlpool for each flux quantum $h/e$ of the magnetic field, where $h$ is the Planck's constant and $e$ the elementary charge of an electron. For the case of $R_H = 3h/e^2$, which was discovered by Tsui and Stormer, derive the ratio of the number of the electrons $N$ to the number of the flux quanta $N_\\phi$.\n4. It turns out that binding an integer number of vortices ($n>1$) with each electron generates a bigger surrounding whirlpool, hence pushes away all other electrons. Therefore, the system can considerably reduce its electrostatic Coulomb energy at the corresponding filling factor. Determine the scaling exponent $\\alpha$ of the amount of energy gain for each electron $\\Delta U(B) \\propto B^{\\alpha}$.\n5. As the magnetic field deviates from the exact filling $v = 1/n$ to a higher field, more vortices (whirlpools in the electron sea) are being created. They are not bound to electrons and behave like particles carrying effectively positive charges, hence known as quasiholes, compared to the negatively charged electrons. The amount of charge deficit in any of these quasiholes amounts to exactly $1/n$ of an electronic charge. An analogous argument can be made for magnetic fields slightly below $v$ and the creation of quasielectrons of negative charge $e^* = -e/n$. At the quantized Hall plateau of $R_H = 3h/e^2$, calculate the amount of change in $B$ that corresponds to the introduction of exactly one fractionally charged quasihole. (When their density is low, the quasiparticles are confined by the random potential generated by impurities and imperfections, hence the Hall resistance remains quantized for a finite range of $B$.)\n6. Calculate the thermal energy $E_{\\text{th}}$ at temperature $T = 1.0$ K.\n7. The electrons spatially confined in the whirlpools (or vortices) have a large kinetic energy. Using the uncertainty relation, estimate the order of magnitude of the kinetic energy. (This amount would also be the additional energy penalty if we put two electrons in the same whirlpool, instead of in two separate whirlpools, due to Pauli exclusion principle.) \nNo mathematical expressions to convert in the provided text.\n8.
