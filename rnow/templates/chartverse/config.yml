project_name: "ChartVerse-RL - Chart Understanding"
description: "Train vision-language models to answer numerical questions about charts using reinforcement learning. Based on ChartVerse-RL-40K, a dataset of 40K challenging chart QA samples specifically curated for RL training. The dataset covers diverse chart types and tests complex visual reasoning including trend analysis, data extraction, and mathematical calculations from visualizations."
