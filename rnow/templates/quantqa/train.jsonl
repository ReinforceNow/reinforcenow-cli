Some water is transferred into the orange juice glass, followed by an equal volume of the blended liquid being poured back into the water glass, restoring the original volumes. Define $x$ as the water percentage in the diluted water glass, and $y$ as the orange juice percentage in the diluted orange juice glass.  Problem Solution: Let the initial (and final) volume of each glass be $V$. Suppose that a volume $t$ of water is transferred from the water glass to the orange juice glass.  After this initial step:  - The orange juice glass now holds $V$ of orange juice and $t$ of water, for a total of $V+t$.  - The water glass is left with $V-t$ of water.  Next, we thoroughly mix the contents of the orange juice glass. Then, we transfer the same volume $t$ of the mixed liquid from the orange juice glass back to the water glass.  Since the mixture in the orange juice glass is homogeneous, the fraction of water in it is $\\frac{t}{V+t}$, and the fraction of orange juice is $\\frac{V}{V+t}$.  Thus, in the transfer back to the water glass:  - The volume of water transferred is $t\\cdot\\frac{t}{V+t}=\\frac{t^2}{V+t}$.  - The volume of orange juice transferred is $t\\cdot\\frac{V}{V+t}=\\frac{Vt}{V+t}$.  Now, let\u2019s compute the final compositions in each glass.  In the water glass:  - Water: It originally had $V-t$ and receives an additional $\\frac{t^2}{V+t}$, so the total water content is $(V-t)+\\frac{t^2}{V+t}$.  - Orange juice: It receives $\\frac{Vt}{V+t}$.  Since the total volume is restored to $V$, the water percentage in the water glass is $x=\\frac{(V-t)+\\frac{t^2}{V+t}}{V}$.  In the orange juice glass:  - Orange Juice: Initially it had $V$, and it loses $\\frac{Vt}{V+t}$ in the transfer, leaving $V-\\frac{Vt}{V+t}$.  - Water: It initially had $t$, and loses $\\frac{t^2}{V+t}$, leaving $t-\\frac{t^2}{V+t}$.  Thus, the orange juice percentage in the orange juice glass is $y=\\frac{V-\\frac{Vt}{V+t}}{V}=1-\\frac{t}{V+t}$.  Let\u2019s simplify $x$. Writing the water in the water glass with a common denominator:  $(V-t)+\\frac{t^2}{V+t}=\\frac{(V-t)(V+t)+t^2}{V+t}=\\frac{V^2-t^2+t^2}{V+t}=\\frac{V^2}{V+t}$.  Thus, $x=\\frac{\\frac{V^2}{V+t}}{V}=\\frac{V}{V+t}$.  Now, note that $y=1-\\frac{t}{V+t}=\\frac{V+t-t}{V+t}=\\frac{V}{V+t}$.

This chamber is placed uniformly at random in one of the chambers.  Two players, $A$ and $B$, take turns pulling the trigger on themselves.  The cylinder rotates in a fixed cyclic order so that if a chamber is fired (or otherwise used), the next chamber in order will be used on the subsequent turn.  However, player $A$ employs a special strategy called the Survival Spin Gambit.   When it is $A$\u2019s turn, instead of firing the chamber that would normally be used according to the fixed order, he deliberately advances the cylinder one extra chamber.  The chamber he skips in this extra advance is permanently removed from play, meaning that its content (whether it held the bullet or not) does not affect the game further.  As a result, the remaining set of active chambers is reduced and any probability for the bullet\u2019s location in later rounds must be renormalized over the surviving chambers.   For example, suppose the chambers are labeled $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6$ in firing order.  In a standard game without the extra spin, player $A$ would fire chamber $1$, $B$ would fire chamber $2$, $A$ would fire chamber $3$, and so forth.  When using the gambit, on his turn $A$ first discards the chamber that would have been used (i.e. chamber $1$) and then fires the very next chamber (i.e. chamber $2$).  Thereafter, $B$ fires the next chamber in the sequence (chamber $3$), then on $A$\u2019s subsequent turn he discards the next chamber (chamber $4$) and fires the chamber following that discard (chamber $5$).  Finally, if the game reaches that point, $B$ would be forced to fire the last remaining chamber (chamber $6$).   In every turn, any chamber that is either fired or discarded is removed from the set of active chambers, and therefore the probabilities regarding the bullet\u2019s location must be updated (renormalized) based on the current set.  Assuming that only player $A$ employs the Survival Spin Gambit while player $B$ follows the standard procedure, determine the probability that this strategy eventually forces player $B$ to fire the chamber that contains the bullet, thereby allowing $A$ to survive the game."}], "rewards": ["accuracy"], "metadata": {"answer": "1/3", "id": "27214098312366593101", "name": "Survival Spin Gambit", "difficulty": "Medium", "tags": ["Conditional Probability", "Probability"], "firms": ["Jane Street"]}}
